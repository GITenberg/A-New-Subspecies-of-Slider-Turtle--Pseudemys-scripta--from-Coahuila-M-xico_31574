<h2>A New Subspecies of Slider Turtle<br />
(Pseudemys scripta) from Coahuila, M&eacute;xico</h2>

<h5>BY</h5>

<h5>JOHN M. LEGLER</h5>


<p>In September, 1958, the author and two colleagues collected a large
series of <i>Pseudemys</i> in small ponds and in a river in the basin of
Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas, Coahuila. The specimens prove to represent a
previously unrecognized subspecies of <i>Pseudemys scripta</i>. The
subspecies is named in honor of Edward Harrison Taylor who has
contributed more than any other person to our present knowledge of the
herpetofauna of M&eacute;xico.</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Holotype.</i>&mdash;Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., No. 46952, adult female,
alcoholic; 16 km. S Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas, Coahuila, M&eacute;xico; 6 September
1958; original number 1694 John M. Legler.</p>

<p><i>Paratypes.</i>&mdash;A total of 52 specimens as follows (numbers or series of
numbers marked with an asterisk are for specimens prepared as dry
shell with soft parts in alcohol): KU 46932-4*, 46949-51, 46953-67,
46969 (females), 46935*, 46936-48, 46968 (males), same data as
holotype, 6 to 8 September 1958; UU 3416 (male), same locality, 29 to
30 July 1959; KU 46971, 46973* (females), 46972 (male), 46970, 46974

(female), 8.5 mi. SW Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas, 1 August 1959.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;A subspecies of <i>Pseudemys scripta</i> most closely
resembling <i>P. s. elegans</i>, but differing from that subspecies in
having: 1) extensive <i>black</i> plastral pattern, all parts of which are
interconnected, covering approximately half of plastron; 2) tendency
toward melanism, in large adults of both sexes, especially noticeable
on posterior part of plastron; 3) cutting edge of lower jaw coarsely
serrate; 4) tendency for femoral edges of plastron to be reflected
ventrally, especially in males; and, 5) pectoral scute longer than
gular.</p></div>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Description of holotype</i> (measurements given in
Table 1).&mdash;Carapace oval in dorsal aspect, slightly narrowed
behind, nearly straight across anterior margin, bluntly serrate
behind; shell deep, highly arched in cross section; height of shell 53
per cent of width; surface of shell having longitudinal striations;
middorsal keel weakly developed, scarcely discernible except on third
central lamina; lateral margin of carapace not at all reflected,
posterolateral margins flared outward; central laminae all broader
than long, the first urn-shaped.</p>

<p>Ground color of carapace (hereinafter, colors are those of preserved
specimen) dark olive; upper surface of each marginal scute having round or oval
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
black mark, two such marks on each marginal of first pair; marks on
margin of anterior half of carapace having pale orange-yellow borders,
marks more posteriorly having indistinct borders or no border; upper
surface of carapace having numerous, irregularly arranged black marks
on a faint reticulum of pale lines; one or two large oval marks on
each lateral scute arranged more or less vertically, other marks on
laterals irregular in size and arrangement; central scutes having
three to five longitudinally arranged, narrow black marks on each
scute.</p>

<p>Ground color of plastron pale yellow, anterior half extensively marked
with black along laminal seams; all plastral markings interconnected;
undersurfaces of marginals on anterior half of shell having pale
centers; undersurfaces of posterior marginals and posterior half of
plastron solid black.</p>

<p>Plastron more or less evenly rounded in front, slightly indented on
gular border; posterolateral free edge of plastron reflected slightly
downward; posterior border of plastron having wide shallow anal notch;
plastral laminae, in order of length&mdash;abdominal, anal, pectoral,
gular, femoral, humeral; abdominal lamina longer than combined lengths
of pectoral and humeral or humeral and gular.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Head moderately wide; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, curving
evenly backward and downward from nostrils in profile; upper jaw
notched in middle, cutting edges finely and unevenly serrate, crushing
surfaces having distinct ridge bearing fine denticulations but no
large teeth; cutting edges of lower jaw coarsely and evenly serrate,
tooth at symphysis relatively large; raised ridges of lower crushing
surfaces each having low blunt tooth and many fine denticulations.</p>

<p>Major markings of head and neck as follows: narrow stripe beginning at
posterior edge of eye and extending downward and backward (across
tympanum) on side of neck to shoulder (stripe wider behind than at
origin); wide stripe from lower posterior corner of eye extending
downward, across mandibular articulation (and below tympanum) on
throat to shoulder (wider at origin than behind); postorbital mark,
four to five millimeters wide, approximately 26 millimeters long,
connected to eye by narrow isthmus anteriorly and continuous with
narrow stripe on upper part of neck posteriorly; stripe on mandibular
symphysis widened and bifurcated posteriorly, its two branches
enclosing one wide and two narrow stripes; wide stripe beginning in
middle of mandibular ramus and running backward to point below
mandibular articulation on each side; top of head, sides of snout, and
areas between above-mentioned major stripes, marked with numerous,
fine, often indistinct pale lines.</p>

<p>Pale dorsal stripe on fleshy portion of each finger, those of second
and fourth fingers continuous to mid-humeral region, those of other
fingers broken on anterior face of antebrachium; upper and lower pale
stripes of antebrachium joined in mid-humeral region.</p>

<p><i>Coloration of living specimens.</i>&mdash;Ground color of soft parts
dark olive to slate gray or black; ground color of carapace olive to
slate gray; ground color of plastron pale yellow, markings blackish,
tinged with brown in younger specimens, sooty black in most adults.
Postorbital mark red; other markings on soft parts cream to buffy
yellow.</p>

<p><i>Geographic range.</i>&mdash;<i>Pseudemys scripta taylori</i> is known only
from ponds, and the R&iacute;o Chiquito in the basin of Cuatro
Ci&eacute;negas. The discovery of <i>taylori</i> brings to six the number
of valid subspecies of <i>scripta</i> known in M&eacute;xico (<i>elegans</i>,
<i>gaigeae</i>, <i>hiltoni</i>, <i>nebulosa</i>, <i>ornata</i>, and <i>taylori</i>) and to
three (<i>elegans</i>, <i>gaigeae</i>, and <i>taylori</i>) the number known in
Coahuila. My own studies of these six subspecies indicate that they
are, beyond reasonable doubt, members of a single polytypic species
(<i>scripta</i>). I tentatively follow Williams (1956:153) in rejecting
"<i>cataspila</i>" as an invalid name.</p>

<p>Three specimens of <i>Pseudemys scripta</i> obtained by Robert G. Webb in
the R&iacute;o Chiquito at a point 8 mi. W of Nadadores, 2100 ft.,
where the river flows out of the basin of Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas, have
many characteristics in common with <i>taylori</i>, but resemble <i>elegans</i>
closely in several characters as follows: no extensive melanism;
plastral markings tending to be brownish; anterior plastral markings
smudgelike, isolated or nearly isolated; markings on lateral scutes
tending to have vertical, linear arrangement; cutting edge of mandible
weakly serrate; femoral edges of plastron not reflected ventrally; one
or more fine, pale lines between two major stripes on antebrachium;
gular longer than pectoral in one specimen, longer than femoral in
both specimens. The nature of these specimens suggests that parts of
the R&iacute;o Salado drainage north and east of Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas
are in a zone of intergradation between <i>taylori</i> and <i>elegans</i>.
I have examined what I consider to be typical examples of <i>P. s.</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
<i>elegans</i> from the region of M&uacute;zquiz (CNHM
28843-45, 55625-45), and from Don Mart&iacute;n Reservoir (KU 33524).
These localities are, respectively, approximately 70 miles
north-northeast and 100 miles east-northeast of Cuatro
Ci&eacute;negas. The specimens from M&uacute;zquiz are presumably the
same that Carr (1952:262) treated as "... <i>elegans-cataspila</i>
intergrades, but with a strong leaning toward eastern <i>elegans</i>...."
Populations of <i>P. scripta</i> in central eastern Coahuila (between the
above-mentioned localities and Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas) probably are a
conglomerate of only two subspecies (<i>elegans</i> and <i>taylori</i>), not
including <i>gaigeae</i> (as was suggested by Hamilton, 1947:65 and by
Carr, op. cit.:241, map 17;262).</p>

<p>Specimens reported by Schmidt and Owens (1944:101) as <i>P. s. gaigeae</i>
(from several localities in the region mentioned above) have been
examined in the course of my study and prove to be <i>P. floridana
texana</i>. A specimen reported by Shannon and Smith (1949:399; IU 4094,
Hidalgo Co., Texas) as being either <i>gaigeae</i> or an <i>elegans-gaigeae</i>
intergrade, has been examined and is here regarded as a typical
specimen of <i>elegans</i>. I regard <i>P. s. gaigeae</i> as a subspecies of the
upper R&iacute;o Grande and disrupted parts of that drainage; the
range of that subspecies meets that of <i>P. s. elegans</i> somewhere
between the Big Bend region and Piedras Negras. In any event, the
influence of <i>gaigeae</i> is not so widespread as other authors (Carr,
<i>loc. cit.</i>; Hamilton, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Hartweg, 1939:3-4) have indicated.</p>

<p>Further collecting in the R&iacute;o Salado and its tributaries east
and north of Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas will be necessary before the exact
range of <i>P. s. taylori</i> can be determined.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;Characteristics ascribed to the holotype pertain in
general to all specimens in the hypodigm, except as noted below. The
postorbital mark is in contact with the eye on one or both sides in 46
per cent of the specimens (narrowly separated from eye in remainder)
and is in contact with a neck stripe (on one or both sides) in 35 per
cent of the specimens. The pattern of the antebrachium is as shown in
Fig. 2 in all specimens except that the thin lateral stripe is
obliterated by melanism in older specimens of both sexes. The lateral
edges of the posterior plastral lobe are reflected downward, at least
slightly, in all but one specimen (an adult, kyphotic female). The
first central lamina is straight-sided in juveniles and becomes
urn-shaped only in adults. The relative height of the shell tends to
increase with a general increase in size in both sexes.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;Of the five other subspecies of Mexican <i>P. scripta</i>
mentioned above, three subspecies (<i>gaigeae</i>, <i>hiltoni</i>, and
<i>nebulosa</i>) form a natural group herein referred to as the <i>gaigeae</i>
group. <i>Pseudemys s. taylori</i> is distinguished from members of the
<i>gaigeae</i> group by elongate, red postorbital mark (yellow or orange in
the <i>gaigeae</i> group), extensive black plastral pattern (narrow&mdash;or if
wide, brownish&mdash;in <i>gaigeae</i> group), and serrate lower jaw (nearly
smooth in <i>gaigeae</i> group).</p>

<p>The subspecies <i>P. scripta taylori</i> differs from <i>P. scripta elegans</i>
as indicated in the following comparative list of characteristics:</p>

<p>Four specimens of <i>P. s. ornata</i> (MCZ 46392-3, 46397, 46400, two adult females
and two adult males) from the R&iacute;o Soto la Marina drainage of Tamaulipas
differ from <i>P. s. taylori</i> as follows: plastral pattern diffuse and brownish, not
black; gular longer than pectoral; cutting edge of lower jaw only slightly serrate;
stripe on mandibular symphysis isolated, not joined with ventral neck stripes to
form inverted Y; postorbital stripe (yellow in preservative) connected to eye
by narrow isthmus and continuous with neck stripe to shoulder.</p>

<p>In <i>P. s. taylori</i> there is an obtuse ridge or prominence across the bridge, on a
line joining the free lateral edges of the plastron; the area between the ridges
is nearly flat. The bridge forms a distinct plane on each side between the
mentioned ridge and the outer edges of the marginals. In cross section this
plane forms an angle of 30 to 45 degrees with the horizontal plane of the
plastron. The higher bridge and deeper shell of <i>taylori</i> result in a slightly
higher center of gravity in this subspecies than in the specimens of <i>elegans</i> and
<i>ornata</i> I have examined. In the two subspecies last named the longitudinal
ridges on the plastron are indistinct or wanting and the bridge forms a lesser
angle with the horizontal plane of the plastron.</p>

<p>The largest female of <i>taylori</i> (218 mm.) is shorter by some 30 mm. than the
smaller female in the series of <i>ornata</i> from Tamaulipas whereas the largest male
of <i>taylori</i> (179 mm.) is shorter by some 80 mm. than the smaller male from
Tamaulipas. <i>Pseudemys s. taylori</i> probably is smaller, on the average, than
either <i>elegans</i> or northern populations of <i>ornata</i>.</p>

<p>There seems to be no reliable published record of the color of the postorbital
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
mark in living examples of <i>P. s. ornata</i> from Tamaulipas. Williams (1956:147, 154)
indicated that this color may be red or yellow for Mexican and Central
American populations of <i>ornata</i> in general and G&uuml;nther (1885: Pl. 6 b) indicated
that the color was yellow in <i>Emys cataspila</i>; however, both of the observations
mentioned were presumably based on preserved rather than living specimens.
The postorbital marks of a live specimen of <i>ornata</i> (KU 40131) from
southern Veracruz were yellowish to buffy with a pinkish tinge anteriorly (<i>fide</i>
notes of Robert G. Webb and a color photograph by him).</p></div>

<p><i>Natural history.</i>&mdash;Specimens of <i>P. s. taylori</i> were caught in hoop
nets in clear deep pools and in the R&iacute;o Chiquito. No specimens
were collected or observed in marshy situations where the water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
was shallow or stagnant. Individuals were seen only near dusk and
in early morning when a number floated just below the surface with
only their heads showing. They were never seen on land during
our short stay in the basin. The few stomachs that were opened
contained vegetable material. In terms of number of specimens
trapped, <i>P. s. taylori</i> was the most abundant turtle in pools at and
near the type locality (Webb and Legler, 1960).</p>

<p><i>Relationships and phylogeny.</i>&mdash;The basin of Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas now
drains, via the R&iacute;o Salado, into the lower R&iacute;o Grande. Brief descriptions
of habitats and topography in the basin are given by Gilmore
(1947:148-150, fig. 2) and Webb and Legler (1960). In the
more northern parts of the Salado drainage (for example, in the
R&iacute;o Sabinas near M&uacute;zquiz) slider turtles are typical <i>P. s. elegans</i>.
Assuming that conditions which permit genetic exchange between
populations of turtles in the Salado drainage system differ in no
major respect from conditions in other parts of the range of <i>Pseudemys
scripta</i>, it is logical to suppose that the differentiation of <i>P. s.
taylori</i> at Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas was preceded by the isolation of a population
in that basin.</p>

<p>The R&iacute;o Chiquito drains through a narrow gap in the northeastern
end of the basin of Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas. Interruption of this
stream would effectively isolate aquatic habitats in the basin.</p>

<p>It is here proposed that <i>P. s. taylori</i> is a relict of an earlier, lower
R&iacute;o Grande stock, part of which became isolated in the basin of
Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas in postpluvial times. The morphological similarity
of <i>P. s. taylori</i> and <i>P. s. elegans</i> indicates that both were derived
from this parent stock; similarity of both subspecies to populations
of <i>P. s. ornata</i> in Tamaulipas suggests that the latter subspecies may
also be a derivative of the mentioned stock of the lower R&iacute;o Grande.</p>

<p>The proposed former isolation of the basin of Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas is
supported by evidence found in studies of other turtles in the basin.
Of the four kinds of turtles known to occur there (<i>Terrapene
coahuila</i>, <i>P. s. taylori</i>, <i>Trionyx spinifer emoryi</i>, and <i>Trionyx ater</i>),
all but <i>T. spinifer</i> seem to be endemic. These three kinds comprise
a graded series, in regard to their degree of differentiation from
closest known relatives, as follows: 1) <i>Terrapene coahuila</i> is morphologically
the most generalized and primitive of living box turtles;
the species is unique in its highly aquatic mode of life (see Legler,
1960:532-534, for brief discussion of relationships within genus
Terrapene); 2) <i>Trionyx ater</i> seems to represent a relict population
of pre-<i>Trionyx spinifer</i> stock; presumably, <i>spinifer</i> has reinvaded the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
basin of Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas in relatively recent times and, as noted
above, <i>spinifer</i> and <i>ater</i> now occur sympatrically (at least in a
geographic sense) in the basin (Webb and Legler, <i>op. cit.</i>); and,
3) evidence presented above suggests that <i>P. s. taylori</i> intergrades
with <i>P. s. elegans</i> outside the basin.</p>

<p>The three endemic populations of turtles at Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas
therefore, differ by varying degrees from their closest living relatives.
This variation in degree of difference possibly results from
varying periods of isolation. Probably the basin of Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas
has been isolated from, and reconnected to, the lower R&iacute;o Grande
drainage at several times in the past. The relationships of fishes in
the basin, now under study by other workers, also suggest that the
basin was isolated more than once.</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Local names for the above-mentioned localities in the basin of
Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas are as follows: Anteojo (6 mi. W Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas); El
Mojarral (8.5 mi. SW); and Ojo de Agua de T&iacute;o Candido, on Rancho Orozco
(16 km. S). The R&iacute;o Chiquito is referred to by some natives as "R&iacute;o Colorado"
and by some as "R&iacute;o Salado." The local name for <i>P. s. taylori</i> is <i>tortuga negra</i>
(the name is used also for <i>Terrapene coahuila</i>).</p>

<p><i>Acknowledgments.</i>&mdash;For permission to examine specimens in their care,
I wish to thank Doris M. Cochran, Smithsonian Institution (USNM), Ernest
E. Williams, Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Rollin H. Baker, Michigan
State University (MSU), Hobart M. Smith, University of Illinois (IU),
and Robert F. Inger, Chicago Natural History Museum (CNHM). Pete S.
Chrapliwy, John K. Greer, Robert G. Webb, and Kenneth L. Williams all contributed
field data concerning the specimens of <i>P. s. taylori</i> that they collected.
I am especially grateful to Webb for donating two specimens to the University
of Utah (UU). Special gratitude is expressed to Wendell L. Minckley and
Robert B. Wimmer for assistance with field work at Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas. Daniel
Rodr&iacute;guez, Cuatro Ci&eacute;negas, guided us to the various ponds at and near the
type locality. Robert R. Miller, Robert G. Webb, and Donald Tinkle read the
manuscript and offered helpful criticisms. Figures 1 and 2 were drawn by
Lorna Cordonnier.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
